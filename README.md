## Description

We have implemented an online book store using React and GraphQL

There are a lot of shops and the user can choose which shop to navigate to and it will take it to the wanted one.
There are validations before submitting the form with all the personal details.

All the data of the books and the stores have been taken from the backend of the graphql.


There is a logo of the library that is static , in all the pages it will always appear.

 
 There are links/buttons to navigate between pages.
